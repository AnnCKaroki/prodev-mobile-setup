# Mobile Development Environment Setup

## üéØ Project Overview
This project focuses on building a mobile application using React Native, TypeScript, and Expo. This document outlines the environment setup process and any challenges encountered during installation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Framework**: React Native (via Expo)
- **Styling**: StyleSheet API
- **Development Environment**: VS Code
- **Mobile Testing**: Expo Go

## üìã Environment Setup Checklist

### 1. Node.js Installation
**Status**: ‚úÖ Required for React Native development

**Installation Steps**:
1. Download Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Choose the LTS (Long Term Support) version for stability
3. Run the installer and follow the setup wizard
4. Verify installation by opening a terminal and running:
   ```bash
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```

**Challenges Encountered**:
- None - Standard installation process
- Ensure PATH environment variables are properly set during installation

### 2. VS Code Installation
**Status**: ‚úÖ Primary code editor for React Native development

**Installation Steps**:
1. Download VS Code from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Run the installer and follow the setup wizard
3. Install recommended extensions for React Native development:
   - React Native Tools
   - TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features
   - ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets
   - Prettier - Code formatter
   - Auto Rename Tag

**Challenges Encountered**:
- None - Straightforward installation process
- Extension installation may require internet connection

### 3. Expo Go Installation
**Status**: ‚úÖ Required for testing React Native apps on physical devices

**Installation Steps**:
1. **iOS**: Download from the App Store
   - Search for "Expo Go" in the App Store
   - Install the app on your iPhone or iPad
   
2. **Android**: Download from Google Play Store
   - Search for "Expo Go" in the Google Play Store
   - Install the app on your Android device

**Challenges Encountered**:
- Device compatibility: Ensure your device meets minimum requirements
- Network connectivity: Both devices (development machine and mobile device) must be on the same network for local development
- Firewall settings: May need to allow Expo development server through firewall

## üîß Additional Setup Requirements

### Expo CLI Installation
After Node.js is installed, install Expo CLI globally:
```bash
npm install -g @expo/cli
```

### Development Environment Verification
Test your setup by creating a simple Expo project:
```bash
npx create-expo-app@latest test-project
cd test-project
npm start
```

## üì± Testing Setup
1. Start your Expo development server
2. Open Expo Go on your mobile device
3. Scan the QR code displayed in your terminal or browser
4. Your app should load on your device

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Node.js Issues**:
- If `node` or `npm` commands are not recognized, restart your terminal or check PATH environment variables
- On Windows, ensure Node.js is added to PATH during installation

**VS Code Issues**:
- If extensions don't install, check internet connection and VS Code permissions
- Restart VS Code after installing new extensions

**Expo Go Issues**:
- **Connection Problems**: Ensure both devices are on the same WiFi network
- **QR Code Not Scanning**: Try manually entering the URL in Expo Go
- **App Not Loading**: Check firewall settings and allow Expo development server
- **Metro Bundler Errors**: Clear cache with `npx expo start --clear`

**Network Issues**:
- Use `npx expo start --tunnel` if devices are on different networks
- Check antivirus software that might block local development servers

## üìö Next Steps
After completing this environment setup:
1. Create your first React Native project using `npx create-expo-app@latest`
2. Follow the project structure guidelines outlined in the project rules
3. Begin implementing components and screens
4. Test regularly using Expo Go on your physical device

## üìù Notes
- Keep Expo Go updated for the best development experience
- Regularly update Node.js and npm packages
- Consider using Expo's managed workflow for easier development
- Document any additional challenges or solutions discovered during development
